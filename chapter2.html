        <div class="exp">
            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p>
                The way the headmaster masterly resolves these fights reminds me of the way King Oloja, in Village Headmaster... So, as they had their own Village Headmaster, we also have our own Lekki Headmaster.

            <p>
                A good number of Mr. Bepo’s colleagues at Stardom found his reaction concerning the impending relocation funny: extremely funny. Of course, what they really had in mind was that it was stupid.
